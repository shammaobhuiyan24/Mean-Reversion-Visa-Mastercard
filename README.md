# Mean-Reversion-Visa-Mastercard
## Overview
This research project implements a quantitative algorithmic trading strategy in R centered on the concept of mean reversion. By identifying and exploiting temporary price dislocations between Visa and Mastercard, the model seeks to capture alpha from the mean reverting behavior of their price spread. The strategy is market-neutral, meaning it is designed to generate returns regardless of the broader market direction by maintaining simultaneous long and short positions in these highly correlated companies.
## Methodology
The methodology starts with a cointegration analysis to validate that the price relationship is statistically stable over time. I utilised an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the residuals of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to confirm that the spread is stationary and mean reverting. Once validated, the spread was transformed into a Z-score to standardize price deviations. I made the trade signals are trigger when the Z-score reaches a threshold of ±2 standard deviations: a negative Z-score triggers a long position in Visa and a short in Mastercard, while a positive Z-score triggers a long in Mastercard and a short in Visa. Further, to ensure the backtest reflects realistic trading conditions, I implemented a one-day execution lag, preventing any look ahead bias and ensuring that trades are executed on the day after a signal is generated.
## Results
The strategy was evaluated over a five-year backtesting horizon from January 2020 to December 2024.The model achieved a Total Cumulative Return of 398.91%, highlighting the effectiveness of the mean reversion logic across various market cycles. Furthermore, the strategy maintained a respectable performance profile evidenced by an Annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.91. While a ratio below 1.0 isn't considered great, it represents a robust foundation for a market-neutral pairs trade.
